## What is Encrypt-it?
> Encrypt-it is a simple website made by me (Douglas Caron) for my DofE! I really enjoyed creating this website, and I'm looking forwards into improving it in the future!

## 📋 What does it do?
> At the moment, encrypt-it is a very basic website. It's only intent and original intent is to deliver simple text encryption to hide secret messages! It's just for fun.<br>
Right now, encrypt-it runs base64 encryption.

## Contributors
> This website was fully made by me (Douglas) although, thank you to [Loannis P. Drositis](https://twitter.com/idrositis) for giving me some recources.

## What next?
> I actually have a lot of plans to continue this website! First things first, I'd love to implement AES encryption! <br>
Why AES you may ask? It's an extremely secure encryption method! <br>
Second thing, I'd like to add all sorts of PGP related tools! Such as: <br>
1. PGP key generator <br>
2. PGP encryption <br>
3. PGP decryption <br> <br>
But that's pretty much all for now! Thanks for checking out the repository and be sure to star it! <br>
Please stay tuned in for further updates!
